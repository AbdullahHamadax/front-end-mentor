# Frontend Mentor Projects

Welcome to my Frontend Mentor Projects repository! Here you'll find a collection of projects I've completed from **Frontend Mentor**, a great platform designed to improve front-end development skills through **real-world** projects.

## About Frontend Mentor 🎨
Frontend Mentor is a platform that provides a variety of frontend coding challenges to help developers improve their skills. Each challenge includes a design mockup and screenshots with to implement the design using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ( obviously any framework usage is fine, the site doesn't restrict anything.)**

## NOTE ❗
> As I'm still a beginner, my code may contain errors and unnecessary CSS properties. However, with each project, I'm learning and improving, and I'll continue to refine my code as my skills progress.

> Some of the projects require having pro membership to get the figma files, hence why some of my projects are not pixel-perfect.

> Project difficultities: **Newbie, Junior, Intermediate, Advanced, Guru**
